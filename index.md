          <h5>Hi! On this site you can find out more than you'd ever want to know about me, Will Stedden, data scientist, hacker, environmentalist, uncle, possibly artificial intelligence, leftist, and scifi writer (amongst other things).  </h5>
          <h6>I live in <a href="https://www.madisonbikes.org/2020/06/madison-ranked-second-best-us-biking-city/">Madison</a> now, and I'm looking for my next career after taking a professional hiatus to travel the United States by bicycle. My current projects are starting <a href="https://solarpunktravel.org/">a sustainable travel cooperative</a>, <a href="https://solarpunk.blue">writing prefigurative science fiction</a>, and organizing for action on <a href="https://www.madisonccl.info/">climate change</a> and <a href="https://madison-dsa.org/">inequality</a>.</h6>
