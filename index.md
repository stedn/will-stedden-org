My past career has brought me to <a href="https://munrolab.uchicago.edu/events/">biophysical research</a>, a <a href="https://color.com">genomics startup</a>, and an <a href="https://www.anthem.com/employer/the-benefits-guide/collaborative-expertise-to-drive-the-future-of-ai-in-healthcare">AI research team</a> in a large healthcare company.
